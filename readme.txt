Genre: Tactical Action Shooter

Ricochet is a 2D platformer encompassing elements of tactical shooters, platformer and puzzle.
The player dropped behind enemy lines and has to clear the enemies in the level to allow
allies to push through. Players have at their disposal a tank that has the ability to jump,
ricochet projectiles off walls while being able to take multiple hits from opposing enemies.
However, bullet ammunition is limited! The player must make each shot count and clear all 
enemies in the level before proceeding to the next.
